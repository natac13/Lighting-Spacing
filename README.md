# Lighting-Spacing

[Live Example](https://natac13.github.io/Lighting-Spacing/)

A simple form application to take in the dimensions of a room, how many rows of
lights there are and how many lights per row; resulting in the measurments
between the light centers for install.

This was a perfect application to help teach myself CSS Grid and Formik instead
of Redux-Form. I wanted to build the app without Redux this time.
